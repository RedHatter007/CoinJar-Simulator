# CoinJar Simulator

## Overview
CoinJar Simulator is an open-source Go project designed to estimate the number of coins that can fit into a jar. It uses the Monte Carlo simulation method, considering jar and coin dimensions, to provide a statistical approximation of the number of coins.

This simulator is particularly useful in educational settings, for casual estimation challenges, and as a demonstration of applying computational methods to solve everyday problems.

## Features
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Utilizes a Monte Carlo method to simulate the random packing of coins into a jar.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can input dimensions of the jar and coins for personalized simulations.
- **Adjustable Packing Density**: Accommodates different packing densities to account for the efficiency of space usage within the jar.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. Visit [the Go installation page](https://golang.org/doc/install) for instructions.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Usage
Run the program using the command:
```
go run coin_jar_simulation.go
```

## Testing
To run the tests, use the following command in the project directory:
```
go test
```
